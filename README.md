Checklist (Required: 3/9) (Optional: 0/1)
(Put an * in front of the requirement to signify that it is finished)
# Input
* Create a Voltage Calculator
* Ask for Time to Simulate \n
Ask for Input Resistance and Capacitance \n

# Saving and Recursion
Create the program to put the time, v_in, and v_out to a CSV file \n
Be able to ask the user if he/she wants to run another simulation using different values (refer to [1]) \n
Clean the Code, Transfer CLasses to separate Header, Move Some computations to functions \n

# Additional Optional Stuff
