CE 30 - Project 2

Checklist (Required: 3/9) (Optional: 0/1)
(Put an * at the back of the requirement to signify that it is finished)
# Input
* Create a Voltage Calculator *
* Ask for Time to Simulate *
* Ask for Input Resistance and Capacitance 
* Find a way to make switching Voltages, Resistances, and Capacitances Quickly [1] 

# Process
* Create the Necessary Voltages *
* Runge Kutta Computation Process 

# Saving and Recursion
* Create the program to put the time, v_in, and v_out to a CSV file 
* Be able to ask the user if he/she wants to run another simulation using different values (refer to [1]) 
* Clean the Code, Transfer CLasses to separate Header, Move Some computations to functions 

# Additional Optional Stuff
* Create a UI
